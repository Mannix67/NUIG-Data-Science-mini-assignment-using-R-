# 1. Complete the following: (40 marks)
a. Using the t test function in R, determine if there is a statistically significant difference in the height
of players in two sports teams (α = 0.05):
i. Team A: [175, 160, 163, 190, 178, 169, 180, 171, 185, 176]
ii. Team B: [173, 162, 158, 186, 179, 162, 163, 172, 168, 172]


b. Specify the null hypothesis.

c. What is the t value, p value and degrees of freedom?


d. What can we say about the height of the players in the two teams? Refer to the null hypothesis.


# 2. Complete the following (Hint: look at week 7 lecture slides 44 onwards): (25 marks)
a. Create an extra column in the ‘daily’ data frame called ‘Month’, a variable for the month of the year
of each observation. Month should be an integer.


b. What month of the year had the highest total number of flights on Wednesday? 

What month of the year had the lowest total number of flights on Saturday? 

Report the number of Wednesday/Saturday flights for both of these months. Hint: Use Group_by() and Summarise().


# 3. Complete the following (Hint: look at week 7 lecture slides 44 onwards): (35 marks)

a. Create a linear model that predicts the number of flights each day based on weekday and month.

b. Plot the residuals over time (similar the plot on slide 46).

c. Calculate the average and maximum absolute value of the residuals and print to the consol
